This was made mainly to teach myself GameMaker Studio 2, with the help some of the tutorials on GameMaker Studio's website.
I'll come back to this project when I want to experiment with leaderboards or the gamepad support.
For the time being, I wanna try to actually make a project and push it out.
It'll more than likely be a mobile focused game so I can learn that system.
